The project has the basic functionality of a sphere bouncing in a cube-shaped room, with the sphere starting at random directions and velocities.
I also included materials on the faces of the room and on the sphere, and a point light which creates a shadow for the ball.
Moving the mouse rotates the camera, but this was included in the tutorial framework, I didn't implement it.

Use "./OgreApp" to run the program after building.
